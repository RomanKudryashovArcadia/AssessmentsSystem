# Assessments System

Using _Test-First Development_ build the functionality below:
* There is a _Testlet_ with a fixed set of 10 items. 6 of the items are operational and 4 of them are pretest items.
* The requirement is that the _order_ of these items should be randomized such that:
    * The first 2 items are always pretest items selected randomly from the 4 pretest items.
    * The next 8 items are mix of pretest and operational items ordered randomly from the remaining 8 items.
